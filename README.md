# EmacsConfig

My Emacs Config File.

In use are the packages:
 - Material Theme https://github.com/cpaulik/emacs-material-theme
 - magic-latex-buffer https://github.com/zk-phi/magic-latex-buffer
 - centered-line-mode http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/centered-cursor-mode.el

It also contains the themes:
 - Zenburn
 - Monokai
 - Seti

These packages and themes are not authored by me and the init.el file is itself based on different source. Everyone is welcome to use my configuration.
